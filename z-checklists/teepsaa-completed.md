---

## Marketplace — Payment Confirmation

- [x] Vendor dashboard: incoming orders appear once status is `paid`
- [x] Vendor clicks Mark dispatched → order status → `dispatched`

---

## Marketplace — Delivery

- [x] Buyer sees all orders with status bar in `/dashboard-buyer/`
- [x] Buyer clicks Confirm delivery → order status → `delivered`
- [x] Auto-confirm after 24 hours — `cron/auto-confirm.php` marks stale `dispatched` orders as `delivered`, emails admin payout list

---

## Marketplace — Vendor Payout

- [x] `aba_qr` column on `vendors` table — vendors upload their ABA QR from vendor dashboard
- [x] Admin Orders popup — `delivered` orders show vendor ABA QR and Mark completed button
- [x] Admin clicks Mark completed → order status → `completed`
- [x] Vendor dashboard shows ABA QR upload section with current QR preview

---

## Marketplace — Admin Dashboard

- [x] Admin dashboard: 2 tabs — Vendors and Orders
- [x] Vendors tab — all vendors (approved/pending/rejected), click → popup with business info, approve/reject actions
- [x] Orders tab — all orders, filterable by status with counts, click → popup with full order detail
- [x] Payment confirm/reject and vendor payout both handled inside order popup
- [x] Order popups: itemized table, status bar, vendor ABA QR for payouts

---

## Marketplace — UX

- [x] Order detail popup — clicking any order (admin/vendor/buyer) shows full breakdown
- [x] Vendor pending visibility — vendors see orders in `pending` state before payment confirmed
- [x] Buyer payment status — "Payment submitted" label; amber note on pending orders
- [x] Shared 5-step order status bar (`/order-status/order-status.php`) across all stakeholders
- [x] Order ID format: `YYMMDD-0000` (e.g. `260514-0003`)
- [x] Popup modal pattern — `js/popup.js` + `/popup/popup.css` used across admin, vendor, buyer

---

- [x] Vendor settings — `/dashboard-vendor/settings/` with Account (name, phone, avatar upload), Business (map pin reposition, ABA QR upload), Password, Danger zone (blocked if open orders)
- [x] Admin settings — password change form as a Settings tab in the admin panel (`/admin/settings.php`) alongside Vendors and Orders
- [x] Avatar dropdown — buyer and vendor headers replace Settings + Logout links with a circle avatar button (photo or name initial) that opens a Settings/Logout dropdown
- [x] Session sync — `user_name` and `user_avatar` stored in session at login, updated on save; avatar initial updates immediately without re-login
- [x] Vendor orders moved to Products tab — `/products/?tab=orders` replaces standalone vendor dashboard orders; header trimmed to Products + avatar dropdown

---

## Marketplace — Order Status Refresh

- [x] API endpoint — `api/order-status.php` — role-aware GET endpoint, returns `{"status":"…"}` or 401/404
- [x] JS module — `js/status-refresh.js` — `initStatusRefresh()`, re-renders status bar in-place, updates matching popup if open
- [x] Single refresh button per section — SVG icon next to "My Orders", "Incoming Orders", "Orders" headings; spins on click
- [x] Toast — green viewport-spanning bar on status change, red on error or session expiry
- [x] Action button sync — dispatch/confirm-delivery/payout buttons show/hide based on new status without page reload
- [x] Admin filter note — toast appends "Reload page to remove from this filter" when viewing a filtered status list

---

## Admin Filters & Search

- [x] Vendors tab — search by name or email; filter by All / Pending / Approved / Rejected / No business
- [x] Orders tab — search by order ID, buyer name, or business name; filter by date range; filter by status (`?status=` query param)

---

## Security

- [x] Brute force protection — `login_attempts` table + `config/rate-limit.php`; 5 failures per IP in 15 min triggers 15 min lockout on all three login portals
- [x] XSS in map popups — `escHtml()` in `map.js` escapes all vendor-supplied strings before DOM injection
- [x] File upload hardening — `config/upload.php` validates magic bytes (JPEG/PNG) in all 8 upload handlers; `uploads/.htaccess` blocks PHP execution in `/uploads/` (also closes off disguised-PHP-shell-via-upload and raw DB access via a web shell)
- [x] `/dev/` folder deleted
- [x] HTTPS enforcement — root `.htaccess` redirects `teepsaa.com`/`www.teepsaa.com` to HTTPS via `mod_rewrite`; `session.cookie_secure` set dynamically per-request (true only when the request is actually HTTPS), so local MAMP HTTP dev is unaffected
- [x] IDOR audit on orders — every buyer/vendor-facing file accepting a user-suppliable ID (`dashboard-buyer/`, `dashboard-vendor/`, `orders-vendor/`, `messages-*`, `review/`, `cart/`, `api/`, `products/`, `contact-*`, `wishlist/`, `checkout/`) scopes its query to the authenticated user (`buyer_user_id=?`, `b.user_id=?` vendor→business join, or `sender_id=?`/`role=?`)
- [x] Stock race condition — `checkout/confirm.php` checks `rowCount()` after stock decrement; rolls back if stock ran out mid-checkout
- [x] Session cookie hardening — all `session_start()` call sites (165+) pass `cookie_httponly`/`cookie_samesite=Strict`/`cookie_secure` directly, so it works under PHP-FPM/MAMP with no `php.ini`/`.htaccess` dependency
- [x] `config/db.php` exposure — `config/.htaccess` has `Deny from all`, blocking any request into `/config/` regardless of PHP misconfiguration
- [x] Sequential IDs → UUIDs — random `public_id` (UUID v4) column added to `businesses`, `products`, `orders` (`database/migration-public-ids.sql`), generated via `uuid_v4()` in `config/db.php`. All buyer/vendor-facing URLs, outgoing links, canonical/SEO URLs, sitemap entries, and notification/email links use `public_id` instead of the sequential int `id`; the int `id` stays as the internal PK for joins/FKs and ownership-scoped POST actions. Admin pages intentionally keep the int `id` (admin is fully trusted)
- [x] SQL injection — PDO prepared statements on all queries
- [x] CSRF — `csrf_verify()` on all POST forms
- [x] Password storage — bcrypt via `password_hash()`
- [x] Session fixation — `session_regenerate_id(true)` on every login
- [x] Role enforcement — hard walls between buyer, vendor, and admin logins
- [x] Ownership checks — vendors can only edit their own products and businesses

### Found & Fixed (2026-07-04 review)
- [x] Verification OTP leaked to browser in production — `$_SESSION['dev_otp']` set unconditionally in `register-buyer.php`/`register-vendor.php`/`resend-verification/resend.php`, echoed via `console.log()` in `verify-email/index.php` regardless of environment; gated behind `DEV_MODE` at both the set and display sites
- [x] Cart/checkout missing buyer-role check — `cart/add.php`, `cart/index.php`, `cart/update.php`, `checkout/index.php`, `checkout/confirm.php` only checked `isset($_SESSION['user_id'])`, not `role === 'buyer'`; a logged-in vendor could hit another user's cart/address/order data on an id collision between the separate `buyers`/`vendors` tables. Added the `role !== 'buyer'` guard used everywhere else
- [x] Dead legacy auth cluster (`/login/`, `/register/`, `/dashboard/`) — pre-role-split pages querying a `users` table that no longer exists; `footer/footer.php`'s logged-out links pointed here instead of `/login-buyer/`/`/register-buyer/`. Footer links fixed, dead folders removed
- [x] No throttling on email-verification code guesses — `verify-email/verify.php` wired into the existing `config/rate-limit.php` (5-per-15-min IP limiter)
- [x] No throttling on password-reset / resend-verification / job applications — added `check_rate_limit()`/`record_failed_attempt()` to `forgot-password-buyer/request.php`, `forgot-password-vendor/request.php`, `resend-verification/resend.php`, `careers/apply.php`
- [x] Open redirect via `redirect` POST param / `HTTP_REFERER` — `cart/add.php` echoed `$_POST['redirect']` straight into `header('Location: ...')`; `lang/set.php`/`currency/set.php` did the same with the raw referer. `cart/add.php` now requires a same-site relative path (rejects `//host` too); the other two verify the referer's host matches `HTTP_HOST`

---

---

## Email Verification

- [x] Schema — `email_verified_at DATETIME NULL` and `verify_token VARCHAR(64) NULL` added to `buyers` and `vendors` → `database/add-email-verification.sql`

## Khmer / English Localization (bilingual site) — completed 2026-07-04

Full EN/KM language toggle across the whole app. A header flag toggle sets `$_SESSION['lang']` (default `km`); every page loads `$t` from `lang/en.php` / `lang/km.php` (~581 keys, EN/KM parity maintained). Admin dashboard stays English by design.

### Infrastructure
- [x] `lang/en.php` + `lang/km.php` — keyed string dictionaries (real Khmer, not machine placeholders); `header/header.php` loads `$t` per session lang; `footer/footer.php` has its own `$t` guard-load
- [x] Toggle `lang/set.php`; **persistence** — writes choice to the `buyers`/`vendors` `lang` column, restored into the session at login (`login-buyer.php`/`login-vendor.php`); column default aligned to `km` (`migration-lang-default-km.sql`)
- [x] Khmer web font — **Noto Sans Khmer** in `style.css` `@import` + body font stack (per-glyph fallback)
- [x] Brand renders uniformly as **`ទីផ្សារ`** in Khmer; per-language footer tagline (Pacifico EN / Metal KM)
- [x] Shared display helpers in `config/db.php`: `lang_field($row,$field)` (for `field`/`field_km` rows) and `pick_lang($base,$km)` (for aliased columns) — Khmer optional, English fallback
- [x] Date localization — `config/i18n.php` `fmt_date($fmt,$when)` + `km_num()` (Khmer month/weekday names, am/pm, Khmer numerals); swept 12 non-admin display files (`date(` → `fmt_date(`), data/input `date('Y-m-d…')` left untouched
- [x] Global JS strings — `header/header.php` emits `window.T` (per-language `js_*` keys); `js/status-refresh.js` (status-bar labels, toasts) + `js/notifications.js` ("No notifications yet"/"Loading…") read it with English fallbacks

### UI wired to `$t` (every user-facing page)
- [x] Header, footer, homepage, search (+ sort labels/chips), product page (+ inline JS), cart, checkout
- [x] Login/register — all portals (`login/`, `login-buyer/`, `login-vendor/`, `register/`, `register-buyer/`, `register-vendor/`); auth recovery (`forgot-password-*`, `reset-password-*`, `verify-email/`, `resend-verification/`)
- [x] Buyer dashboard — wishlist, orders, settings (all tabs + address JS), messages, order detail + full refund/return flow; shared `order-status`/`refund-status` bars
- [x] Vendor dashboard — dashboard, orders-vendor (list/detail/refund), settings (all tabs), submit, messages, and the 1156-line `products/index.php` product manager (+ inline JS)
- [x] Contact forms (`contact/`, `contact-buyer/`, `contact-vendor/` — issue-type value→label maps), `business/` storefront, `review/` form (+ JS star labels)
- [x] Static content pages — `about/`, and `privacy/`, `terms/`, `shipping/`, `returns/`, `help/` (FAQ) as per-page bilingual `$lang` blocks (one block per page for native Khmer review)

### Bilingual content (vendor/admin-entered, KM optional + EN fallback)
- [x] Bilingual **banners** — `title_km`/`subtitle_km`; admin edit form with EN+KM fields
- [x] **Category names** — `categories.name_km`; admin editor; displayed on homepage tiles, search filter, vendor cascades
- [x] **Product name + description** — `products.name_km`/`description_km`; vendor form + save; displayed on product page, cards (homepage/search/`api/search`), storefront, wishlist, cart, checkout, product manager
- [x] **Business name + description** — `businesses.name_km`/`description_km`; vendor settings; storefront + all buyer-facing seller-name displays (incl. `api/recently-viewed` — added missing `session_start()`)
- [x] **Variant / option labels** — `product_option_types.name_km`, `product_option_values.label_km`, `product_variants.label_km`; KM box beside each EN box in both variant builders; composed variant `label_km` auto-built from values
- [x] **Job postings / careers** — `job_postings.title_km`/`location_km`/`description_km`; `employment_type` via `$t` map; admin form + public `careers/`/`apply.php`
- [x] **Order-item snapshots** — `order_items.product_name_km`/`variant_label_km` captured at checkout (`checkout/confirm.php`); order-detail/history/review pages show the language-correct snapshot (`dashboard-buyer/order.php`, `orders-vendor/order.php` + `refund.php`, `review/index.php`), old rows fall back to English

### Bilingual emails + notifications
- [x] **All user-facing emails are bilingual** — Khmer on top, English below. `notification_email_html_bi()` + `email_subject_bi()` in `config/notify.php`; covers order received, payment/dispatch/payout/delivery, low stock, abandoned cart, review reminder, verification code, password reset (job-application email → admin stays English)
- [x] **In-app notifications** render in the current toggle language — `notifications.data` JSON column stores params; `notification_text($row,$t)` translates by `type` (`notif_*` keys); `api/notifications/` translates message + time-ago; old rows fall back to stored English
- [x] **Staff-editable email templates** — `email_templates` table + `config/email-templates.php` defaults/fallback + `database/seed-email-templates.php` (10 templates); `render_email_template($pdo,$key,$data)` substitutes `{tokens}`; admin UI under `admin/messages/` (`emails.php` list → `email-edit.php` bilingual editor with live preview → `email-save.php` with required-token protection), tab in the messages role-tab bar

### Intentionally left English
- `<title>` tags (browser-tab text, brand convention); `/admin/*` dashboard; user-authored content (reviews, support messages, refund-reason free text, buyer addresses)

## Vendor Promo Trial

Early vendors get a 0% royalty trial via a promo code from vendor pitches; trial ends once BOTH 3 months have passed AND the vendor exceeds $100 in completed sales.

- [x] `promo_codes` table + `businesses.promo_code_id`/`trial_starts_at`/`trial_ends_at`/`royalty_free_threshold` — `database/migration-vendorpromo.sql`
- [x] `admin/promo-codes.php` — create/list codes, uses_count/uses_limit, active toggle
- [x] Vendor registration — optional promo code field, validated and captured
- [x] Trial starts on approval (not registration) — `admin/action.php`
- [x] Checkout royalty override — `checkout/confirm.php` sets `$effectiveRate = 0` while trial active
- [x] Vendor dashboard trial banner — progress toward $100/3-month trial end

---

## Notifications (Resend)

Transactional email via Resend — `config/mail.php`.

- [x] All 4 original trigger points — payment confirmed → buyer, order dispatched → buyer, delivery confirmed → vendor, payout sent → vendor
- [x] Plus more added since — abandoned cart, review reminders, low stock alerts (see their own sections above)

---

## Discount Codes / Coupons

Buyers apply a code at checkout for a percent/fixed discount, capped by min order and max uses. Discount is a platform-absorbed marketing cost — vendor royalty/payout stays on the pre-discount subtotal.

- [x] `coupons` + `coupon_uses` tables, `orders.coupon_id`/`coupon_code`/`discount_amount` — `database/migration-coupons.sql`
- [x] `config/coupon.php` — shared `validate_coupon()` (active/date-window/max-uses/min-order/one-use-per-buyer), used by checkout preview, confirm.php, and the API endpoint alike
- [x] `admin/coupons.php` + `admin/coupon-action.php` — inline-editable list (create/edit/toggle/delete); expired codes read-only; delete blocked once a code has been used
- [x] `api/coupon/validate.php` — JSON validation endpoint
- [x] `checkout/apply-coupon.php` + `checkout/index.php` — session-based apply/remove UX, live discount line on summary
- [x] `checkout/confirm.php` — re-validates server-side, atomic race-safe `used_count` increment, proportional discount allocation across multi-vendor order groups, `coupon_uses` row per order, discount line in confirmation email
- [x] Refund/total displays corrected for discount everywhere `orders.subtotal` was shown as the buyer-paid amount — `dashboard-buyer/order.php`, `orders-vendor/refund.php`, `admin/refunds.php`, `admin/refund.php`, `admin/order.php`
- [x] Bilingual UI strings — `lang/en.php` / `lang/km.php`

## Granular Admin RBAC

Replaced the all-or-nothing admin (`is_admin=1` → full access) with a **super + granular per-section** model: one bypass-all role, plus custom admins scoped to exactly the sections they're granted.

- [x] `database/migration-admin-roles.sql` — `admins.admin_role ENUM('super','custom')`; `admin_permissions` join table (`admin_id`, `section`, FK ON DELETE CASCADE)
- [x] `config/admin-auth.php` — `admin_can()`/`admin_require()`/`admin_is_super()`/`admin_home_url()`; `ADMIN_SECTION_GROUPS` (Admin/Orders/Marketing/Messages); `'admins'` section hardcoded super-only so a super can never hand out the ability to create more supers
- [x] Guard threaded into every `/admin/*.php` page (redirect to home section with `?denied=1`) and every `*-action.php` handler (enforcement is server-side, not just hidden nav — a scoped admin can't bypass by POSTing directly)
- [x] Nav filtered by granted sections — `admin/admin-tabs.php` + header admin nav, desktop and mobile
- [x] `admin/admins.php` + `admin/admins-action.php` — super-only management screen: clickable admin rows expand into an inline edit form (shared `admin_form_fields()` renders both create and edit); real CSS toggle switches per section plus a per-group toggle that grants/revokes a whole group at once; "Clear all"; "Add new admin" section at the bottom; "Reset password" field on existing admins (labeled to reflect there's no separate admin forgot-password flow — it's the only account-recovery path)
- [x] Guards — last active super admin can't be deleted/deactivated/demoted; an admin can't delete or deactivate themselves
- [x] `is_owner` flag on `admins` — settable only via direct DB write, never exposed in any form; `do_delete()`/`do_toggle_active()` hard-block deletion/deactivation of an owner account regardless of who's requesting it or how many other supers exist; roster shows a green "Owner" badge and hides Delete/Reactivate on that row for everyone

## Content CMS (Static Pages + FAQ)

Moved the hardcoded static content pages (Privacy, Terms, Shipping, Returns) and the Help Center FAQ out of code and into the database so admins can edit them (bilingual EN + KM) without a deploy. Body text is Markdown, rendered server-side by a small dependency-free renderer. About page intentionally stays on `$t` translation keys (not migrated).

- [x] `database/migration-content-pages.sql` — `content_pages` (slug, title_en/km, body_en/km MEDIUMTEXT, updated_at, updated_by) + `faq_items` (section_en/km, question_en/km, answer_en/km, sort_order, active)
- [x] `database/seed-content.php` — idempotent PDO seed; migrated existing hand-written EN/KM prose (privacy/terms/shipping/returns) into Markdown, and the Help page's hardcoded FAQ arrays into `faq_items` (23 items across 6 sections)
- [x] `config/markdown.php` — `render_markdown()`: escapes all HTML first, then parses `## headings`, `- lists`, blank-line paragraphs, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[text](url)` (scheme-allowlisted against `javascript:` links). No third-party library needed
- [x] RBAC — new `'Content' => ['content' => 'Pages', 'faq' => 'FAQ']` group in `config/admin-auth.php`'s `ADMIN_SECTION_GROUPS`/`ADMIN_SECTION_HOME`; own top-level nav group (desktop + mobile + admin tab bar), not folded into Marketing
- [x] `admin/content.php` + `admin/content-action.php` — accordion list of the 4 fixed-slug pages; clicking a row (native `<details>`/`<summary>`, no JS) expands its edit form inline — English fields (Title, Body) grouped under an "English" heading, Khmer fields under a "ខ្មែរ" heading; no separate Edit button/page
- [x] `admin/faq.php` + `admin/faq-action.php` — same accordion-per-row pattern for FAQ items, grouped by section; per-row controls (reorder ▲▼, Hide/Show, Delete) stay in the clickable row header via `event.stopPropagation()` on their forms; "Add FAQ item" is its own dropdown styled as a plain button (no card chrome); redirects reopen the correct row/add-panel on validation error or after save
- [x] Public pages rewritten to read from DB with `pick_lang()` bilingual fallback — `privacy/`, `terms/`, `shipping/`, `returns/index.php` (+ preserved original CSS look via `:has()`-based structural selectors since the generic renderer no longer emits page-specific classes), `help/index.php` (FAQ grouped by resolved section name, `WHERE active = 1`)
- [x] Verified: migration + seed run against dev DB (4 content_pages rows, 23 faq_items rows across the expected 6 sections), all touched files pass `php -l`, admin screens and public pages checked in-browser

## Three-Subdomain Layout — completed 2026-07-06 (live)

Same codebase, same `public_html`, same database — a host check routes which paths answer on which domain. `teepsaa.com` = buyers + all public pages; `vendor.teepsaa.com` = vendor portal; `admin.teepsaa.com` = admin only (admin paths 404 everywhere else). Subdomains are not secret (SSL cert-transparency logs list them) — the win is separation plus a place for extra locks.

- [x] `config/subdomain.php` — routing brain behind `SUBDOMAINS_ENABLED` (now `true`); always inert on localhost/CLI, so MAMP and cron behave as a single domain. Defines `IS_VENDOR_SUBDOMAIN` / `IS_ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN` + `BASE_URL_MAIN/VENDOR/ADMIN` (empty when inactive so relative links keep working)
- [x] Enforcement (central path-prefix map, query strings preserved): vendor paths off the vendor host → 302 to `vendor.teepsaa.com`; admin paths (`/admin/`, `/login-admin/`) anywhere but the admin host → 404; public paths on vendor/admin hosts → 302 to `teepsaa.com` (`/` → `/dashboard-vendor/` on vendor, `/admin/` on admin); neutral paths (`/api/`, `/lang/`, `/currency/`, `/logout/`, `/cron/`, `/verify-email/`, `/resend-verification/`) answer on every host
- [x] Wrong door, right person — logged-in vendor on the bare `teepsaa.com` homepage → vendor dashboard (homepage only; vendors can still preview their public product/business pages)
- [x] Load hooks — `require_once` in `config/i18n.php` (loaded via db.php on every page; db.php itself is unmanaged on the server so it can't hold the require) **and** `config/csrf.php` (pages like `login-admin/` use csrf.php without db.php), plus direct requires in the 5 public pages that load neither (`about/`, `contact/`, `contact/thanks/`, `orders/`, `account/`)
- [x] Shared session cookie across subdomains — `'cookie_domain' => str_ends_with($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] ?? '', 'teepsaa.com') ? '.teepsaa.com' : ''` added to every `session_start()` options block (171 files; empty string on localhost keeps MAMP host-only cookies). Done in code because **Hostinger disables `.user.ini` entirely** (`user_ini.filename` is empty on their LiteSpeed PHP 8.3) — the planned `.user.ini` approach silently did nothing and the server file was deleted
- [x] hPanel — `vendor` + `admin` subdomains created pointing at the same `public_html` ("Custom folder" + "Use public_html directory"), DNS auto-created, SSL valid on all three; pre-launch Basic Auth gate covers all three (same folder, same `.htaccess`)
- [x] `.htaccess` — `.user.ini` added to the blocked-files pattern (harmless belt-and-braces)
- [x] Live tests passed (curl, all three hosts): routing redirects/404s exactly per the map above; `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=…; domain=.teepsaa.com; secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` issued on all three hosts; `/style.css` + `/js/*` load 200 on all three; localhost unaffected
- [x] Found & fixed during review: (1) `/login-admin/` returned 200 on main/vendor hosts because 14 pages never load db.php — fixed via the csrf.php hook + 5 direct requires; (2) session cookie had no `domain=` because Hostinger ignores `.user.ini` — fixed with the 171-file `cookie_domain` insert
- [x] Deferred (optional): link-audit polish — cross-domain links currently work by bounce (relative link → enforcement redirect); emails/hot links could use the `BASE_URL_*` constants to skip the hop. Extra Basic Auth on `admin.teepsaa.com` moved to the security checklist
